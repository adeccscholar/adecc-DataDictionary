#this repositiory will contain the adecc DataDictionary from the live stream

The "adecc Dictionary" is a project to generate not only error-free C++ source texts for the system layer and 
access to the data from a collection of metadata created in Excel, but also the scripts for creating the database 
and, almost more importantly, meaningful technical documentation. Special files (.dox) for Doxygen are generated here. 
In general, it is of course also possible to create other programming languages or types of documentation.

The two libraries "adecc Scholar" and "adecc Database" previously created in projects here on the stream are created 
in conjunction with Visual Studio 2022 and Qt6, whereby we currently only support the MS SQL Server. But here, too, 
it is easy to adapt the program to other database servers.

The project is licensed under the MIT license and can be used and adapted under the given conditions.
